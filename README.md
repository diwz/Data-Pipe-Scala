# Coding tasks for data engineers

Hello and welcome to the coding tasks for data engineers! The exercise covers [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.0/programming-guide.html), [Dataframes](http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.0/sql-programming-guide.html), Scala/Java and is all about ETL. We hope you will enjoy this!

### Tasks

The goals of the tasks are to pass all tests and implement it in a way that it performs very well for big data. The steps in detail:

1. Fork the project and create a new branch for your implementation
2. Implement the function, according to documentation and tests
3. Run and pass all tests
4. Update the chapter "Describe your solution" in the README files
5. Create a pull request

### Comment

You're not familiar with Scala, this is no problem. Just implement it in Java and replace the [Implicit Class](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/implicit-classes.html) with an instance of your Java class.
